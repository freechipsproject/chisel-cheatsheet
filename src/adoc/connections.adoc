| Example | kind | Description
| `x := y`    | basic connector                     | `y drives x`
| `bundle1 <> bundle2` | Chisel basic bulk connect | requirements on bundle matching

#### Turducken bulk operators
[cols="2,2,5"]
|===
| `data1 :<>= data2` | symmetric operator |
| `data1 :>= data2` | producer on RHS | the right-hand-side of the connection; will always drive leaf connections, and never get driven by leaf connections ("aligned connection")
| `data1 :\<= data2` | producer on LHS | the right-hand-side of the connection; will always be driven by leaf connections, and never drive leaf connections ("flipped connection")
| `data1 :#= data2` | RHS is producer | all members will be driving, none will be driven-to
