=== Connection operators
Connection operators can be confusing
Notion of producer and consumer
Of the form <LHS> <op> <RHS>

| Example | kind | Description
| `x := y`    | basic connector                     | `y drives x`
| `bundle1 <> bundle2` | Chisel basic bulk connect | requirements on bundle matching

| `c := p`   |   (mono-direction): connects all p members to c; requires c & p to not have any flipped members
| `c :#= p`  |    (coercing mono-direction): connects all p members to c; regardless of alignment
| `c :<= p`  |    (aligned-direction): connects all aligned (non-flipped) c members from p
| `c :>= p`  |    (flipped-direction): connects all flipped p members from c
| `c :<>= p` |     (bi-direction operator): connects all aligned c members from p; all flipped p members from c

These operators may appear to be a random collection of symbols; however, the characters are consistent between operators and self-describe the semantics of each operator:

* `:` always indicates the consumer, or left-hand-side, of the operator.
* `=` always indicates the producer, or right-hand-side, of the operator.
* Hence, `c := p` connects a consumer (`c`) and a producer (`p`).
* `<` always indicates that some members will be driven producer-to-consumer, or right-to-left.
* Hence, `c :<= p` drives members in producer (`p`) to members in consumer (`c`).
* `>` always indicates that some signals will be driven consumer-to-producer, or left-to-right.
* Hence, `c :>= p` drives members in consumer (`c`) to members producer (`p`).
* Hence, `c :<>= p` both drives members from `p` to `c` and from `c` to `p`.
* `#` always indicates to ignore member alignment and to drive producer-to-consumer.
* Hence, `c :#= p` always drives members from `p` to `c` ignoring direction.

| `data1 :<>= data2` | symmetric operator |
| `data1 :>= data2` | producer on RHS | the right-hand-side of the connection; will always drive leaf connections, and never get driven by leaf connections ("aligned connection")
| `data1 :\<= data2` | producer on LHS | the right-hand-side of the connection; will always be driven by leaf connections, and never drive leaf connections ("flipped connection")
| `data1 :#= data2` | RHS is producer | all members will be driving, none will be driven-to
