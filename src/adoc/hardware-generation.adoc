= Hardware Generation
:toc:

== Functions
Functions provide block abstractions for code. Scala functions that instantiate or return Chisel types are code generators. +

Also: Scalaâ€™s `if` and `for` can be used to control hardware generation and are equivalent to Verilog's `if`/`for`
```
val number = Reg(if(canBeNegative) SInt() else UInt ())
```
will create a Register of type SInt or UInt depending on the value of a Scala variable
